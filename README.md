# Maya Playback Snap Tool

The playback snap tool allows animators to quickly flick through their frames/play their animation and snap back to the frame they started on. 

This functionality can be toggled on or off by running the script or clicking the created shelf button. 

# Install
Download the ZIP folder and drag and drop the installer into your Maya instance. This will copy the code into your Maya scripts folder and create a button to run the tool on the active shelf.
